This is a collection of all of the labs I did for my Data Structures class. The textbook we used was [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=pd_sbs_14_2/137-7674581-6772508?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=032157351X&pd_rd_r=c29bc0ed-d0c0-4299-8948-9a104b23b1c4&pd_rd_w=lFmkY&pd_rd_wg=IRQhG&pf_rd_p=d66372fe-68a6-48a3-90ec-41d7f64212be&pf_rd_r=EE43BH40X88BHTQZ6J2H&psc=1&refRID=EE43BH40X88BHTQZ6J2H) by Robert Sedgewick. There are also many other online resources that you can find in my [Useful Books, Guides, Videos, Websites, & Links Repo](https://github.com/NawalJAhmed/Useful-Books-Guides-Videos-Websites-Links).
